## Overview
This program allows individuals to find the best routes to their destinations and plan theur next trip on what activities they want to do. In this program, we have provided three scripts that allows users to determine a depth-firtst path between two airports, the shortest path between two airports, and given a number of location, they will be given the different potential round trips they can take. Our implementation of this program begins with our graph class. Given a text file containing a flights destinations and locations, we are able to parse the data and store it in a hash map consisting of name and a vector continaing the destination airports and its distance. Using this data, we apply our traversal and cycle detection algorithms to provide the user with the necessary outputs.
